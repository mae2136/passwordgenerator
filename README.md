# Week 3 Assignment - Password Generator
## Repository to generate a random password of various types.

Welcome to my password generator readme. This repository contains the code for my password generator. The initial commit has the base code that was provided by my boot camp at Northwestern University. Otherwise, the javascript was all written by me.

It has the following functionality:

```
Allows a user to generate a random password upon clicking the "Generate Password" button. 

There are several criteria the user is allowed to choose from:

    - Lower case letters
    - Upper case letters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols

This page also allows a user to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters.

The page will then generate a random password that meets all of the criteria the user selected. All criteria are validated both at user input and after initial password generation for correctness.
```

## Credits
I would like to thank my wife, Amanda, for letting me talk through my solution at her. It probably sounds like a bunch of gibberish to her, but helps me immensely.

I would also like to credit my teacher, teaching assistant, and current classmates at Northwestern bootcamp for providing me the resources to practice and create a the website you see here. They provided the index.html and style.css so I could focus on the Javascript portion of this website.
